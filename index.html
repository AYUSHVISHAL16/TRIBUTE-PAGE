    <h1 class="about">ABOUT THE LEGEND</h1>
    <p class="info">
      <strong>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen</strong> Abdul Kalam BR
      <b>(abdul kəlam 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015)</b> was an Indian
      aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of
      India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu
      and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four
      decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence
      Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
      Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space
      programme and military missile development efforts He thus came to be
      known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of
      ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a
      pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's
      Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear
      test by India in 1974.[5] Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India
      in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the
      then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the
      "People's President",[6] he returned to his civilian life of education,
      writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of
      several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest
      civilian honour. While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of
      Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac
      arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.[7] Thousands, including national-level
      dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of
      Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.

    <h2 class="about">Early life and education</h2>
    <p class="info">
      Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a
      Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban
      Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu.
      His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local
      mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.[10][11][12][13] His father
      owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram
      and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.[14][15] Kalam was the youngest of
      four brothers and one sister in his family.[16][17][18] His ancestors had
      been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties
      and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in
      coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and
      local women. The family business had involved trading groceries between
      the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying
      pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban
      Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the
      family fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the
      ancestral home. The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was
      born. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the family's
      meager income. [19][20][21] In his school years, Kalam had average grades
      but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a strong
      desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially
      Mathematics.[21] After completing his education at Schwartz Higher
      Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend the St. Joseph's
      College, Tiruchirappalli from where he graduated in Physics in 1954.[22]
      Kalam moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras
      Institute of Technology.[13] While Kalam was working on a senior class
      project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and
      threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished
      within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean,
      who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to
      meet a difficult deadline."[23] He narrowly missed achieving his dream of
      becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight
      positions were available in the IAF

    <h2 class="about">Career as a scientist</h2>
    <p class="info">
      Career as a scientist This was my first stage, in which I learnt
      leadership from three great teachers—Dr Vikram Sarabhai, Prof Satish
      Dhawan and Dr Brahm Prakash. This was the time of learning and acquisition
      of knowledge for me. A P J Abdul Kalam[25] After graduating from the
      Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical
      Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development
      Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a
      scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development
      Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but
      remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.[26] Kalam joined the
      INCOSPAR, working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.[13]
      He was interviewed and recruited into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy, the first
      Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS).[27] In
      1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation
      (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch
      Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in
      near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an
      expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.[1] In 1969, Kalam
      received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include
      more engineers.[25] Kalam addresses engineering students at IIT Guwahati
      In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton,
      Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops
      Flight Facility.[11][28] Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort
      to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects,
      both of which proved to be successful. Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna
      to witness the country's first nuclear test Smiling Buddha as the
      representative of TBRL, even though he had not participated in its
      development. In the 1970s, Kalam also directed two projects, Project Devil
      and Project Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic missiles from the
      technology of the successful SLV programme.[29] Despite the disapproval of
      the Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for
      these aerospace projects through her discretionary powers under Kalam's
      directorship.[29] Kalam played an integral role convincing the Union
      Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these classified aerospace
      projects.[29] His research and educational leadership brought him great
      laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the government to
      initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship.[29] Kalam
      and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the Defence
      Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R.
      Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous development of a quiver of
      missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after another.[30] R
      Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for
      allocating ₹ 3.88 billion for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile
      Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief
      executive.[30] Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under
      the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and
      Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, although the projects
      have been criticised for mismanagement and cost and time overruns.[30][31]
      Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and
      Secretary of the Defence Research and Development Organisation from July
      1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during
      this period in which he played an intensive political and technological
      role. Kalam served as the Chief Project Coordinator, along with Rajagopala
      Chidambaram, during the testing phase.[11][32] Media coverage of Kalam
      during this period made him the country's best known nuclear
      scientist.[33] However, the director of the site test, K Santhanam, said
      that the thermonuclear bomb had been a "fizzle" and criticised Kalam for
      issuing an incorrect report.[34] Both Kalam and Chidambaram dismissed the
      claims.[35] In 1998, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a
      low cost coronary stent, named the "Kalam-Raju Stent".[36][37] In 2012,
      the duo designed a rugged tablet computer for health care in rural areas,
      which was named the "Kalam-Raju Tablet".[38]
    </p>
    <h2 class="about">Presidency</h2>
    <p class="info">
      Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan.
      He won the 2002 presidential election with an electoral vote of 922,884,
      surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from
      25 July 2002, to 25 July 2007.[39] On 10 June 2002, the National
      Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time, expressed that
      they would nominate Kalam for the post of President,[40][41] and both the
      Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist Congress Party backed his
      candidacy.[42][43] After the Samajwadi Party announced its support for
      Kalam, Narayanan chose not to seek a second term in office, leaving the
      field clear.[44] Kalam said of the announcement of his candidature: I am
      really overwhelmed. Everywhere both in Internet and in other media, I have
      been asked for a message. I was thinking what message I can give to the
      people of the country at this juncture.[45] On 18 June, Kalam filed his
      nomination papers in the Indian Parliament, accompanied by Vajpayee and
      his senior Cabinet colleagues The polling for the presidential election
      began on 15 July 2002, in Parliament and the state assemblies, with the
      media claiming that the election was a one-sided affair and Kalam's
      victory was a foregone conclusion; the count was held on 18 July.[47]
      Kalam became the 11th president of the Republic of India in an easy
      victory,[48] and moved into the Rashtrapati Bhavan after he was sworn in
      on 25 July.[49] Kalam was the third President of India to have been
      honoured with a Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour, before
      becoming the President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1954) and Zakir Husain
      (1963) were the earlier recipients of Bharat Ratna who later became the
      President of India.[50] He was also the first scientist and the first
      bachelor to occupy Rashtrapati Bhawan.[51] During his term as president,
      he was affectionately known as the People's President,[52][53][54] saying
      that signing the Office of Profit Bill was the toughest decision he had
      taken during his tenure.[55][56][57] Kalam was criticised for his inaction
      in deciding the fate of 20 out of the 21 mercy petitions submitted to him
      during his tenure.[58] Article 72 of the Constitution of India empowers
      the President of India to grant pardons, and suspend or commute the death
      sentence of convicts on death row.[58][59] Kalam acted on only one mercy
      plea in his five-year tenure as president, rejecting the plea of rapist
      Dhananjoy Chatterjee, who was later hanged.[58] Perhaps the most notable
      plea was from Afzal Guru, a Kashmiri terrorist who was convicted of
      conspiracy in the December 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament and was
      sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of India in 2004.[59] While the
      sentence was scheduled to be carried out on 20 October 2006, the pending
      action on his mercy plea resulted in him remaining on death row.[59] He
      also took the controversial decision to impose President's Rule in Bihar
      in 2005.[60] In September 2003, in an interactive session in PGI
      Chandigarh, Kalam supported the need of Uniform Civil Code in India,
      keeping in view the population of the country.[61][62][63][64] At the end
      of his term, on 20 June 2007, Kalam expressed his willingness to consider
      a second term in office provided there was certainty about his victory in
      the 2007 presidential election.[65] However, two days later, he decided
      not to contest the Presidential election again stating that he wanted to
      avoid involving Rashtrapati Bhavan from any political processes.[66] He
      was proposed by third front named United National Progressive Alliance
      leader J. Jayalalithaa and coordinator Chandrababu Naidu other leaders
      Mulayam Singh Yadav and Om Prakash Chautala, but he did not have the
      support of the left parties, Shiv Sena and UPA constituents, to receive a
      renewed mandate.[67][68] Nearing the expiry of the term of the 12th
      President Pratibha Patil on 24 July 2012, media reports in April claimed
      that Kalam was likely to be nominated for his second term.[69][70][71]
      After the reports, social networking sites witnessed a number of people
      supporting his candidature.[72][73] The BJP potentially backed his
      nomination[failed verification], saying that the party would lend their
      support if the Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party and Indian National
      Congress proposed him for the 2012 presidential election.[74][75] A month
      ahead of the election, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mamata Banerjee also
      expressed their support for Kalam.[76] Indian National Congress opposed
      the nomination of Kalam in 2012.[77] Days afterwards, Mulayam Singh Yadav
      backed out, leaving Mamata Banerjee as the solitary supporter.[78] On 18
      June 2012, Kalam declined to contest the 2012 presidential poll. He said
      of his decision not to do so

    <h2 class="about">Death</h2>
    <p class="info">
      On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on
      "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at the Indian Institute of Management
      Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some
      discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest.[86]
      At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, he
      collapsed.[87][88] He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a
      critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of
      life.[87] Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was
      confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m. IST.[87][89][90]
      His last words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: "Funny guy!
      Are you doing well?"[91] Following his death, Kalam's body was airlifted
      in an Indian Air Force helicopter from Shillong to Guwahati, from where it
      was flown to New Delhi on the morning of 28 July in an air force C-130J
      Hercules. The flight landed at Palam Air Base that afternoon and was
      received by the President, the vice-president, the Prime Minister, Chief
      Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal, and the three service chiefs of the
      Indian Armed Forces, who laid wreaths on Kalam's body.[92] His body was
      then placed on a gun carriage draped with the Indian flag and taken to his
      Delhi residence at 10 Rajaji Marg; there, the public and numerous
      dignitaries paid homage, including former prime minister Manmohan Singh,
      Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice-president Rahul Gandhi, and Uttar
      Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.[93] On the morning of 29 July,
      Kalam's body, wrapped in the Indian flag, was taken to Palam Air Base and
      flown to Madurai in an air force C-130J aircraft, arriving at Madurai
      Airport that afternoon. His body was received at the airport by the three
      service chiefs and national and state dignitaries, including cabinet
      ministers Manohar Parrikar, Venkaiah Naidu, Pon Radhakrishnan and the
      governors of Tamil Nadu and Meghalaya, K Rosaiah and V. Shanmuganathan.
      After a brief ceremony, Kalam's body was flown by air force helicopter to
      the town of Mandapam, from where it was taken in an army truck to his
      hometown of Rameswaram. Upon arriving at Rameswaram, his body was
      displayed in an open area in front of the local bus station to allow the
      public to pay their final respects until 8 p.m. that evening.[94][95] On
      30 July 2015, the former president was laid to rest at Rameswaram's Pei
      Karumbu Ground with full state honours. Over 350,000 people attended the
      last rites, including the Prime Minister, the governor of Tamil Nadu and
      the chief ministers of Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh.[96][97]
